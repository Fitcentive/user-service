= User Service

== Description
A reactive/rest microservice to handle and serve data pertaining to users

== Pre-requisites
1. https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started[keycloak server] to validate token
2. Java 8+
3. Sbt
4. Postgres

== Running service locally
1. This service has a dependency on the `auth-service`. Either run that locally as well, or use `kubectl` port forwarding to make it available
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/user-service 9001:9000`
2. This service has a dependency on the `social-service`. Either run that locally as well, or use `kubectl` port forwarding to make it available
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/social-service 9002:9000`
3. This service has a dependency on the `image-service`. Either run that locally as well, or use `kubectl` port forwarding to make it available
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/image-service 10260:10260`
4. This service also needs access to a keycloak server running on port 8080
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/auth-keycloak-http 8080:80`
5. This service also requires access to a postgres database
    - Database should be running on `localhost:1210` with `username: postgres` and `password: postgres`
6. This service also needs internet access to connect to Google Pub/Sub APIs
7. `sbt clean run`
8. `curl http://localhost:9000/api/user/health` to bootstrap the server

== Deploy to minikube cluster

'''

=== Pre-requisites
Note - these pre-requisites need only be done **once ever**. If you are deploying another service and you have already completed these steps, no need to repeat them (but follow steps that weren't executed before)

==== 1. Start a single node `minikube` cluter with enough resources
1. `minikube -p=hyperkit --memory 8192 --cpus 8 start`
2.  **Note** - use the `hyperkit` driver otherwise TLS will not work

==== 2. Enable TLS on minikube cluster
1. `mkcert "*.vid.app"`
2. `kubectl -n kube-system create secret tls mkcert --key key.pem --cert cert.pem`
3. `minikube addons configure ingress`
4. Verify that certificate was enabled
- `kubectl -n ingress-nginx get deployment ingress-nginx-controller -o yaml | grep "kube-system"`
5. For a comprehensive set of instructions, https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/custom_cert_ingress/[refer to the minikube docs]

==== 3. Add DNS entry to local hosts file
1. `sudo vi /etc/hosts`
2. Add the following entry to the file below `127.0.0.1     localhost`
- `192.168.64.3 api.vid.app`

==== 4. Add database ssh tunnel
1. `ssh -i $(minikube -p=hyperkit ssh-key) docker@$(minikube -p=hyperkit ip) -R 1211:localhost:1211 -R 1212:localhost:1212 -R 1210:localhost:1210 -R 1213:localhost:1213`
2. Note - Only `localhost:1210` is needed for this service, but other services' tunnels can be bundled into this one command

'''

=== 1. Delete existing deployment and build fresh image
1. `kubectl delete deployment/user-service`
2. `eval $(minikube --profile=hyperkit docker-env)`
3. `docker image ls | grep user`
4. `docker image rm user`
5. `docker image rm <image_hash>`
6. `sbt docker:publishLocal`


=== 2. Deploy manifests to minikube
1. Ensure you are on the right `kubectl` context
2. `cd deployment`
3. `kubectl apply -f minikube/`

=== 3. Verify working of server
1. `curl http://api.vid.app/api/user/healthz`
- Should return a `200` with response `Server is alive!`


==== Note
1. The generated SSL certificate might need explicit trusting by you on your browser for the first time
2. For the certificate to be accepted on Android or iOS devices, you have to import the certificate into the device and trust it manually
- For Android or iOS, copy the `rootCA.pem` or `rootCA.der` file generated in step 1 into the device filesystem. Then, follow device specific instructions to trust the certificate
- One might require conversion of `.pem` to `.der` or vice versa - make sure you use the right format (conversion is easy via a quick search)
